# Prediction-opioid-abuse
This is an academic project on the prediction of opiod abuse in the United States. This project was carried out for 3 subjects ( Automatic Model Selection, Predictive Methods, Machine Learning)

The report of the project will be in the PDF file

These are the instructions to replicate our results 

We have 5 scripts :

The 1)
Data pre-processing.ipynb used to clean the database and to do descriptives statistiques
For the USA map : use also the database : "usa_states.csv"

The 2)
selection de variables -2-3.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in class with S. Laurent with Lasso, Ridge, PCA, Elastic Net
Forward_final.ipynb with Forward method

The 3)
modele.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in class with P. Michel with Kmeans, Kmeans with PCA, Gradient Descent Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network

The 4)
Model_LDA.ipynb
Model_RF.ipynb
Models_KNN.ipynb
Models_SVM.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in class with E.Gallic with LDA, Random Forest, KNN and SVM


the original database was sent by we transfer, this is the file : opioid_use_data.csv
